This is a snake game I made! 
Inside this project there are 3 main sections. The entities, the Gamepanel and the main class. 
The entities include the snake and an apple. These classes draw the entites and keeps track of their location on the GamePanel.
The GamePanel is the game functions. It updates the snakes position whenever it moves in any 4 directions and also randomly moves the apple to a different spot whenever the snake eats it. The GamePanel also draws the initialized the game and restarts it whenever the snake dies. 
The main class just runs the program.
